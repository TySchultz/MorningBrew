	<string>Robinhood, the popular zero-fee stock trading app, has set its sights on something bigger than Wall Street&apos;s brokerages: the entire [consumer banking](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/13/robinhood-goes-after-banks-with-checking-and-savings-accounts.html) sector.

It unveiled &quot;**Robinhood Checking &amp; Savings**&quot; yesterday, causing millennials to pause their [biweekly canned tuna ritual bonfires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQbmjKCbFLE) to get on the list for the sleek debit card.

Beyond aesthetically pleasing plastic, Robinhood is offering **no fees**, and it&apos;s giving users a **3% annual interest rate** in both savings and checking accounts—that&apos;s roughly _30x_ the national average.

(FYI, it&apos;s [insured](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-13/robinhood-will-offer-checking-service-promising-3-interest?srnd=premium) by the SIPC, not the FDIC. The Securities Investor Protection Corp. covers brokerage accounts.)

Robinhood&apos;s trying to live up to the name
-----------------------------------------

The startup has been sending the big fish scrambling...

*   Its no-fee trading undercut old-school brokerages—remember, TD Ameritrade charges $6.95 per equity trade and Schwab $4.95.
*   Now, retail banking will put the likes of Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo under pressure, especially given Robinhood&apos;s &quot;[basically unheard-of rate](https://www.fastcompany.com/90280442/robinhood-launches-checking-and-savings-with-an-almost-unheard-of-3-interest-rate).&quot;

How to outbank a bank
---------------------

Banks make money using account, ATM, and penalty fees (among others). So how will Robinhood keep the lights on in its no-fee world?

**Call it the Amazon Method**—prioritizing _growth_ over _profits_. Robinhood was most recently valued at $5.6 billion and grew to 6 million customers this year (keep in mind, Fidelity manages 26.7 million accounts).

There are always buts
---------------------

**There&apos;s competition**. Goldman Sachs&apos;s Marcus runs a similar offer with a 2.05% annual return, and JPMorgan unveiled a free trading app in August.

**Plus, there&apos;s controversy**. An October [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/robinhood-gets-almost-half-its-revenue-in-controversial-bargain-with-high-speed-traders) found Robinhood gets more than 40% of its revenue from selling customers&apos; orders to high-frequency trading firms. Most every brokerage does it, but the news was a bad look for &quot;trust us, we&apos;re different&quot; Robinhood.

**Bottom line:** Robinhood is [on its way](https://qz.com/1492761/robinhood-will-offer-checking-and-savings-with-with-3-interest/) to becoming a bona fide bank. It doesn&apos;t have a charter yet, but its CEO says that could be in its future.
